## 🚧️ Events

_This page is still under construction_

Our events center around dance as a form of expression, connection, and presence. Alongside dance gatherings, we host hands-on workshops such as permaculture, massage, and inner work.

These spaces are practical, embodied, and grounded. They invite movement, learning, and self-exploration—individually and together. Some events are energetic and social, others quiet and introspective. All are intentional.

Have a look at what’s coming up.
