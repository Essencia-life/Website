### Our Intention

We felt the call to co-create a new safe and sacred space.

We flowed south to the magnificent coasts of Portugal where the Earth is rich and peaceful. 

The Ocean heart-opening and cleansing. The Sun steady and embracing.
The Air clean and rejuvenating. The People slow and sweet

Where conscious folks are gathering and new paradigm communities blooming.

Our steps were to a land called *Essência*

### Our Purpose

is why we show up!

We believe in slow conscious life in nature 

For us and our children to blossom

To restore peace, live in harmony, natural bliss and loving kindness

### Our Vision

is where we want to be!

A world of unity

Remembrance and reliance 

A holy nest where people share, sing,
dance and laugh

Where we live our optimal health, experience our full potential and
paradise on earth

### Our Mission

is what we do about it!

Create a safe, heart-aligned and
sacred spaces in nature where we can purify, regenerate and grow joyfully.

An experience designed to enable integrity and consciousness expansion. From self-responsibility and mastery to freedom.​

A place with activities and a supportive environment to discover and become who I am.

Come in my power and fulfill of my
personal mission on Earth for my highest good and the highest good of all.

We develop an eco community with 22 residents plus guests who come to rest, heal, learn and love

### A Day at Essência

Life at Essência follows a calm, steady flow. Weekdays we start early but gently. At 7:00, we meet for morning meditation, a quiet or guided moment to settle into the day. At 8:00, the morning practice begins — can be movement, breathwork, sometimes less, something more energizing. After a short break, the community meets again at 9:45 for the morning circle. This is where people check in and share their inner truth, we talk about what needs to be worked on and align for the day. Once the circle wraps up, the space shifts naturally into focused work time.

At 14:00 the whole community gathers for lunch. It’s prepared by one or two community beings and eaten together in the circle. After lunch, the afternoon is open. People rest, work on personal projects, explore the land, or spend time on whatever they need.

Thursdays is our **Community Day**, which means everyone is invited to work with us together usually in the garden. In the evening, the day winds down with **SPAkling Night** at 18:00, a warm, light-hearted moment to relax and enjoy the sauna, hot-tub, the pond and singing, jamming around the fire.

Friday late afternoons we are heading to the beach at 17:00. Where we do our **harvest of the week** — a shared reflection on what the week brought and what moved forward. After that, the beach evening offers a slow landing into the weekend: salt water, sunset and dance and sing around a bonfire.
