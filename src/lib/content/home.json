It should be mentioned that it is a strictly vegan + free of any substances (alcohol-, tabaco- free) place and it is a little bit off grid which is all worthy if you are looking for a peaceful silence place to rest and enjoy! Wifi in the main house and the rooms wasn’t working well but therefore they have a common working space with fast starlink connection.",
